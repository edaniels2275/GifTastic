# GifTastic

1. This project is a website that dynamically creates buttons based on user input in a form.

2. Once a buttons is pressed, the Giphy API is called, which generates 10 GIFs on the screen that relate to the topic of the button the user clicked.

3. Each GIF is still when it appears on the screen, and will play indefinitely when clicked on by the user, only stopping when the user clicks it again.

4. When the user clicks another button, 10 new gifs appear on the screen, though the GIFs from the previous button click are not replaced.
